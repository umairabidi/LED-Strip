# LED-Strip-

Some basic code to control the brightness of an RGBW LED strip using an Arduino Nano. 

A 16x2 LCD screen is used to display the brightness of each colour. The LCD is based on the HD44780 driver, it's very common to find such LCDs on ebay and electronic stores.

Pinouts are found in the .ino code. 

Each colour on the LED strip is assigned a potentiometer. Four potentiometers for four colours, very straightforward.
